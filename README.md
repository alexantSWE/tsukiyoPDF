# tsukiyoPDF
super fast, Rust(btw) PDF reader with "Dark Mode" support or at least, that's the goal :)

# inspiration 
getting to know Rust from a hands-on approach (since Rust is a really solid language and also all the craze recently, specially in the Linux space)
I really liked NightPDF project and was hoping to do something remotely similar , if possible, without the help of Electron or Tauri
I still don't know about the UI framework that I'll be choosing, so, at first I would like to have a working CLI

As I'm an utter noob, I'll start with the very basics and slowly crawl my way up to more "advanced" stuff.
**this project will probably stay as "educational", for a long long while**
# basic features
* open and close PDF files,properly (duh)
* Hardware acceleration(we like the word "smooth")
* I know that hardware acceleration isn't exactly a basic thing, but it's very important to me
* no generic wayland logo, please(future me)

# advanced
* annotation, highlighting, basic editing 
* tabbed interface

# want to contribute?
you know the drill :)
create PRs, open issues and get involved 
(later on, I would implement a proper template for reporting issues
