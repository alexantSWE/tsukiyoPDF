# tsukiyoPDF
super fast, Rust(btw) PDF reader with "Dark Mode" support or at least, that's the goal :)

As I'm an utter noob, I'll start with the very basics and slowly crawl (yes, crawl) my way up to more "advanced" stuff.

# The goal is to have minimal dependency on other libraries or Rust crates, as much as possible 
why, you may ask? . not that there is inherntly wrong with dependencies , it's just the "reliance" factor
I don't want the project to be reliant on too many thing, also I want to challenge myself by creating a new piece of software 
# basics
open and close PDF files,properly (duh)
Hardware acceleration(we like the word "smooth")
no generic wayland logo, please

# advanced
annotation, highlighting and stuff
tabbed interface

# want to contribute?
you know the drill :)
create PRs and whatnot 

# what else?
I just want to say:
Good luck, good night
