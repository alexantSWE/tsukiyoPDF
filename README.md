# tsukiyoPDF

A lightweight PDF reader built with Rust, aiming for speed and simplicity.

**(Note: This project is in a very early, experimental stage.)**

THIS ENTIRE PROJECT IS WRITTEN USING AI TOOLS

this is not a flex or anything and no, I'm not going to pretend anything

what I did is to supervise what those tools do and try to guide them tools to a maybe finally functioning program
which, of course, I haven't been successfull
it used to run at some point , but then it broke again

**this project is going read-only mode, not only it was too big of a task, it barely worked due to obscure methods used for implemenations
maybe some day, I find the motivation to do something similar, but for now, I just can't.... something breaks too many things
(even though this project barely has 500 lines of code altogether)... anyways, archiving it is**
