🌙 tsukiyoPDF

🚀 A super fast, Rust-based PDF reader with Dark Mode support (or at least, that's the goal! 😉)

# Arsenal
FLTK (UI)

PDFium-render(backend-renderer)

lopdf(integrate with PDFium and do parsing, processing etc)

# OK, FLTK, really?
yeah, why not?
flkt is super fast, statically linked, comes bundled(with 1 mb or something in size) and
will look the same regardless of platform(yes , it's cross platform as well)
fltk is like a blank canvas, it doesn't hand you abstraction layers, also allows me
to implement awesomly unneeded custom implementation of something as I like to reinvent the wheel, making stuff complicated!
just the way I like it *sips tea*

# 🤔 What’s with the name?

The name comes from the Japanese word 月夜 (Tsukiyo), which literally means "moon night" 🌙 or more poetically, "moonlit night" ✨.

# 💡 Inspiration

Getting to know Rust through a hands-on approach 🦀 (it's a solid language, and it's all the rage recently, especially in the Linux space 🐧).
I was inspired by the NightPDF project and wanted to try something similar, though this project and NightPDF are very different!
My goal is to avoid using Electron or Tauri if possible 💻🚫.

As a complete noob 🍼, I’m starting with the basics and slowly working my way up to more advanced stuff.
Disclaimer: This project will probably stay in "educational" mode for a long time ⏳.

these are stuff that I'm hoping to able to implement
# 🛠️ Basic Features

    📂 Open and close PDF files, properly (duh!)

    ⚡ Hardware acceleration (because we love that smooth experience!)

    🖥️ Hardware acceleration might not be basic, but it’s important to me!

    🚫 No generic Wayland logo, please (future me will thank me)
    

# 🚀 Advanced Features

    ✏️ Annotations, highlighting, and basic editing

    🗂️ Tabbed interface

# 🤝 Want to Contribute?

This project is still in its infancy 🐣, and the future is uncertain 🔮.
You know the drill:

    Create PRs 🧑‍💻

    Open issues 💬

    Get involved! 🙌

Later on, I’ll implement a proper template for reporting issues 📑.
