# tsukiyoPDF
super fast, Rust(btw) PDF reader with "Dark Mode" support or at least, that's the goal :)

# inspiration 
getting to know Rust from a hands-on approach (since Rust is a really solid language and also all the craze recently, specially in the Linux space)

I really liked NightPDF project and was hoping to do something remotely similar(although this and NightPDF are too vastly different) ,
I would like to, if possible, do it without the help of Electron or Tauri

As I'm an utter noob, I'll start with the very basics and slowly crawl my way up to more "advanced" stuff.
**this project will probably stay as "educational", for a long long while**
# basic features
* open and close PDF files,properly (duh)
* Hardware acceleration(we like the word "smooth")
* I know that hardware acceleration isn't exactly a basic thing, but it's very important to me
* no generic wayland logo, please(future me)

# advanced
* annotation, highlighting, basic editing 
* tabbed interface

# want to contribute?
this project is still in it's infancy and it's future is very uncertain
you know the drill :)
create PRs, open issues and get involved 
(later on, I would implement a proper template for reporting issues
