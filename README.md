# tsukiyoPDF
super fast, Rust(btw) PDF reader with "Dark Mode" support or at least, that's the goal :)

As I'm an utter noob, I'll start with the very basics and slowly crawl (yes, crawl) my way up to more "advanced" stuff.
**this project will probably stay as "educational", for a long while**
# basics
* open and close PDF files,properly (duh)
* Hardware acceleration(we like the word "smooth")
* no generic wayland logo, please

# advanced
* annotation, highlighting, editing and stuff
* tabbed interface

# want to contribute?
you know the drill :)
create PRs and whatnot 

# what else?
I just want to say:
Good luck, good night
